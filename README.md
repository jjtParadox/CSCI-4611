# CSCI 4611 Interactive Graphics and Animation

This repo contains all my projects made for the CSCI 4611 class during the Fall 2018 semester.

We were given a simple template for each project that we were expected to build upon. My personal changes are in the `dev/` folder and can be viewed at https://github.com/jjtParadox/CSCI-4611-Interactive-Graphics/commits?author=jjtParadox
