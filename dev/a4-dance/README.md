# CSci-4611 Assignment 4: So You Think Ants Can Dance
Jackson Turner

I successfully completed everything in the 'A' range and below for this project.
The ant models are built using a combination of scales, rotations, and translations to spheres and line segments.
Additionally, the ant models have 6 appendages instead of 4 (these are insects after all).
