# CSci-4611 Assignment 3:  Earthquake
Author: Jackson Turner

The trickiest part of this assignment was getting the transition between sphere and map down. It wasn't terribly clear to me where that transition processing had to go, or if I was supposed to do that by modifying `model_matrix`, but I eventually figured that out. I'm also happy with how the sphere animates as it unfolds into a map, as it's quite satisfying.
