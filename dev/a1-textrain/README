Text Rain, by Jackson Turner

For this project I focused on having the video feed and rain fall animations as smooth as possible. This required moving certain operations to certain threads. It is also why I decided to not mirror the camera view by default.

The poem included is Rain by Robert Louis Stevenson. Words are created by stretching the whole poem across the width of the screen in the negative Y region and significantly randomizing the starting height of each letter.

Controls:

Spacebar - Show debug threshold view.
Up/Down  - Adjust foreground/background threshold.
B        - Enable smoothing of foreground/background threshold (will significantly impact smoothness).
F        - Flip view (will significantly impact smoothness).
